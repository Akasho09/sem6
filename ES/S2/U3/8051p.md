## add 10 byte data from memory loc 50H and stire avg at 40H.
```java
MOV R0, #50H
MOV R1, #10
MOV B , R0 
CLR A 
LOOP:  ADD A , @RO 
       INC RO
       DJNZ R1 , LOOP
DIV AB
MOV 40H , A

```

## The Elements of an  Assembly Language Programming:
- Assembler Directives:
The assembling directives give the directions to the CPU. The 8051 microcontroller consists of various kinds of assembly directives to give the direction to the control unit. The most useful directives are 8051 programming, such as:
    - ORG : 
    ORG(origin): This directive indicates the start of the program. This is used to set the register address during assembly. For example; ORG 0000h tells the compiler all subsequent code starting at address 0000h.
    - DB:
    DB(define byte): The define byte is used to allow a string of bytes. For example, print the “EDGEFX” wherein each character is taken by the address and finally prints the “string” by the DB directly with double quotes.
    eg: s1 DB "akash". 
    - EQU :
    EQU (equivalent): The equivalent directive is used to equate address of the variable.
    eg : N equ,09h  ==> n is replaced eith 9 everyhere ,  n is not havingany memiry loc.
    - END
- Instruction Set
- Addressing Modes

## SET BITS :
PSW.7== Carry bit
PSW.6 == Aux carry 
psw.0 == parity.

## Two strings are stored one after another starting from external memory location 6000H. Each string is terminated by a NULL character (an all-zero byte).
Write separate subprograms to perform:

### (a) String comparison
### (b) String length calculation
The subprograms should use different register banks.

Main program should collect:

- the comparison result in R0

- the length of the first string in R1

- the length of the second string in R2

(all in the default register bank).?

SETB PSW.3           ; Select Register Bank 1
MOV R3, #60H
MOV R4, #00H
ACALL COMPARE

CLR PSW.3            ; Switch back to Register Bank 0
MOV R0, 08H

SETB PSW.3           ; Switch to Register Bank 1 again
MOV R3, #60H
MOV R4, #00H
ACALL LENGTH

CLR PSW.3            ; Switch back to Register Bank 0
MOV R1, 09H
MOV R2, 10H

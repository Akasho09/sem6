## An actuator 
is a device that converts electrical signals into physical actions, enabling embedded systems to interact with the physical environment. In embedded system design, actuators play a crucial role by executing commands from the system's processor to perform tasks such as movement, control, or adjustment.
- force, torque, or displacement, when an electrical, pneumatic or hydraulic input is supplied to it in a system
- While sensors collect data from the environment (input), actuators act on that data to perform tasks (output).
Sensor â†’ Microcontroller â†’ Actuator â†’ Physical Action.

### ðŸ“Œ Example: Automatic Door System
System:
An automatic door opens when it detects a person nearby.

- Components:
Sensor: IR/Ultrasonic sensor detects a person
Microcontroller: Processes sensor input
Actuator: DC motor controls door opening/closing

- Process:
IR sensor detects a person approaching.
Sends a signal to the microcontroller.
Microcontroller triggers a DC motor (actuator).
Door opens/closes accordingly.

In embedded systems, actuators serve as the "hands and feet," translating digital decisions into tangible actions. - Their roles include:
1. Physical Interaction: Actuators enable systems to affect the physical world, such as moving components, opening valves, or emitting sounds.
2. Control Mechanisms: They are integral to control systems, allowing for automation and precise control of processes.
3. Feedback Systems: When combined with sensors, actuators help create closed-loop systems that can adjust actions based on real-time data.


## For a particular product, you determine the NRE cost and the unit cost to be the following for the three listed IC technologies: 
FPGA: (Rs 10000, Rs 50); ASIC: (Rs 50000, Rs 10); VLSI: (Rs 200,000, Rs 5).
Determine precise volumes for which each technology yields the lowest total cost.
Also, draw the graphs between:
(i) Number of units(volume) and total cost
(ii) Number of units (volume) and per product cost
---

The Total Cost (TC) for producing N units is calculated as:
- TC = NRE + (Unit Cost Ã— N)
- compare , get equations and slove .
- make graph

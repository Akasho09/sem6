### Language Processing System in Brief
A Language Processing System (LPS) is a set of tools and processes used to translate high-level programming languages (like C or Java) into machine-executable code. It typically consists of several components:

- Preprocessor: Handles directives (e.g., #include in C) and prepares the source code.
- Compiler: Converts the source code into an intermediate form (e.g., assembly) or machine code, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
- Assembler: Translates assembly code into machine code (if applicable).
- Linker/Loader: Combines object files and libraries into an executable program and loads it into memory.
The LPS bridges human-readable code and machine-level instructions, ensuring correct execution.

### Need for Maintaining Two Buffers in Lexical Analysis
Lexical analysis, the first phase of compilation, breaks source code into tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers). Two buffers are often used to improve efficiency:

- Speed: Reading large chunks of input at once reduces frequent I/O operations, which are slow. Two buffers allow one to be processed while the other is filled.
- Lookahead: Lexical analyzers need to peek ahead to identify token boundaries (e.g., distinguishing if from ifstream). Two buffers ensure smooth handling of tokens spanning buffer ends without reloading.
- Boundary Management: A single buffer risks running out of space or needing complex shifting when a token crosses the end, whereas two buffers simplify this by alternating.

### Sentinel Scheme of Input Buffering in Detail
The sentinel scheme is an optimization for two-buffer lexical analysis, reducing boundary-checking overhead. Here’s how it works:

- Setup:
Two buffers (e.g., Buffer 1 and Buffer 2) are allocated, each holding a fixed number of characters (say, N).
Input is read in blocks from the source file into these buffers alternately.
- Sentinel Concept:
A special character, called a sentinel (typically `EOF` or a unique marker), is appended to the end of each buffer.
This eliminates the need to check for buffer boundaries explicitly in the main loop, as the sentinel signals the end.
Operation:
- Two pointers, forward and beginning, are used:
forward: Scans ahead to identify the end of a token.
beginning: Marks the start of the current token.
The lexical analyzer processes characters in Buffer 1. When forward reaches the sentinel (EOF), it:
Refills Buffer 2 with the next block of input.
Resets forward to the start of Buffer 2.
Continues processing without missing characters across buffers.
Once Buffer 2’s sentinel is hit, Buffer 1 is refilled, and the process alternates.

## Design the SDD for generating syntax tree for Arithmetic Statements. Also, using this SDD, construct the syntax tree for the expression:   a = (b - 2) / (b + c^3)

E->E1=T (E.ptr = new Node ('=' , E1.ptr , T.ptr) )

## ðŸ”¹ Answer 3a: Types of Attributes
1. ðŸ”¹ 1. Synthesized Attributes
Definition: Attributes computed from the attributes of children in the parse tree.
Flow: From bottom to top (inherited by parent from children).
Used in: S-attributed grammars.

Example:
E â†’ E1 + T
E.val = E1.val + T.val
Here, E.val is synthesized using values of children E1 and T.

2. Inherited Attributes
Definition: Attributes computed from the parent or siblings in the parse tree.
Flow: From top to bottom or left to right.
Used in: L-attributed grammars.

Example:
A â†’ B C
C.in = A.in + B.out
Here, C.in is inherited from A.in and B.out.

## Q: What do you understand by Semantic Analysis? Highlight the role and position of a semantic analyser in an ideal compiler. Explain the semantic analysis process in brief.
--- 
- Semantic Analysis is the third phase in the compiler design process (after Lexical Analysis and Syntax Analysis).
It ensures that the program's meaning is correct â€” meaning that it follows the rules of the language beyond just grammar.

### Role :
| Aspect             | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input**          | Syntax tree generated by the parser                                         |
| **Output**         | Annotated syntax tree / intermediate representation                         |
| **Main Role**      | Checks for **semantic consistency** (e.g., type correctness, declarations)  |
| **Key Activities** | Type checking, scope resolution, symbol table handling, function validation |

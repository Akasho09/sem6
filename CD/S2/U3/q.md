## Design the SDD for generating syntax tree for Arithmetic Statements. Also, using this SDD, construct the syntax tree for the expression:   a = (b - 2) / (b + c^3)

E->E1=T (E.ptr = new Node ('=' , E1.ptr , T.ptr) )

## ðŸ”¹ Answer 3a: Types of Attributes
Attributes in syntax-directed translation are used to define semantics. Two major types:

1. Synthesized Attributes
Computed from children to parent in the parse tree.
Suitable for bottom-up parsing.
Example: For expression E â†’ E1 + T,
E.val = E1.val + T.val

2. Inherited Attributes
Passed from parent or siblings to children.
Used in top-down parsing or for passing context.
Example: T â†’ (E) with attribute E.inh = T.inh

| Aspect           | Synthesized            | Inherited               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Direction        | Bottom-up              | Top-down or lateral     |
| Evaluation Order | Post-order (DFS)       | Pre-order or contextual |
| Use Case         | Arithmetic Expressions | Type propagation        |

## Q: What do you understand by Semantic Analysis? Highlight the role and position of a semantic analyser in an ideal compiler. Explain the semantic analysis process in brief.
--- 
- Semantic Analysis is the third phase in the compiler design process (after Lexical Analysis and Syntax Analysis).
It ensures that the program's meaning is correct â€” meaning that it follows the rules of the language beyond just grammar.

### Role :
| Aspect             | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input**          | Syntax tree generated by the parser                                         |
| **Output**         | Annotated syntax tree / intermediate representation                         |
| **Main Role**      | Checks for **semantic consistency** (e.g., type correctness, declarations)  |
| **Key Activities** | Type checking, scope resolution, symbol table handling, function validation |

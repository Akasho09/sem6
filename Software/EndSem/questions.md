âœ… Q No. 1a
> Q: What is the effect of designing a prototype on the overall cost of the software project? Compare V-Model with SPIRAL Model of software development along with a neat diagram.

âœ… Effect of Designing a Prototype:
Early validation of requirements reduces rework.

Better user involvement results in higher customer satisfaction.

Reduces risk of failure in complex systems.

Initial cost increases slightly, but overall cost decreases due to fewer errors in later stages.

Helps uncover missing or misunderstood requirements early in the development lifecycle.

> âœ… V-Model (Verification and Validation Model)
Structure: Extension of Waterfall Model with each development stage paired with a testing phase.

ðŸ“Œ Characteristics:
Emphasis on verification and validation.

Each stage must be completed before the next begins.

Test planning occurs in parallel with development.

âœ… Spiral Model:
Combines prototyping and incremental development with risk analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Phases per spiral:
Planning

Risk Analysis

Engineering

Evaluation

Each loop represents a phase of the software process.

## Unit 5: Software Maintenance
ðŸ“Œ 1. Introduction to Software Maintenance
Definition: Software maintenance involves modifying and updating software after delivery to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt it to a changed environment.

Objective: Ensure the longevity and usability of software by continuously improving it.

### ðŸ“Œ 2. Types of Software Maintenance : CAPP 
1. Corrective Maintenance:
- Fixing errors discovered after the software has been delivered.
Example: Bug fixes or fixing incorrect logic.

2. Adaptive Maintenance:
Adapting software to changes in the environment (e.g., hardware, OS, legal rules).
Example: 
    1. Upgrading to support a new OS version.
    2. A web app was developed for Chrome. Now you update it to work on Microsoft Edge and mobile browsers â†’ adaptive.

3. Perfective Maintenance:
Enhancing performance or maintainability.
Example: 
    1. Improving system performance or restructuring code.
    2. You improve the search feature to support voice input â†’ perfective.


4. Preventive Maintenance:
Making changes to prevent future problems.
Example: Code optimization to reduce future bugs.

### ðŸ“Œ 3. Management of Software Maintenance
Involves planning, estimating, allocating resources, tracking progress, and controlling changes.

Tools used include version control systems, change management software, and maintenance tracking tools.

Importance of maintenance logs, documentation, and impact analysis.

### ðŸ“Œ 4. The Maintenance Process
Steps:

1. Problem and Modification Analysis
2. Maintenance Planning
3. Implementation of Modifications
4. Testing
5. Release and Documentation

- Involves coordination between developers, testers, and stakeholders.

ðŸ“Œ 5. Maintenance Models
1. Quick Fix Model:
Fastest approach; changes are directly made to the code.
Suitable for emergency bug fixes.
Risk: Code degradation over time due to poor structure.

2. Iterative Enhancement Model:
Code is enhanced incrementally in iterations.
Each iteration includes planning, analysis, implementation, and testing.
Helps maintain structure and quality.

3. Reuse-Oriented Model:
Focuses on reusing existing components to implement maintenance changes.
Reduces time and cost but depends on available reusable modules.

### ðŸ“Œ 6. Reverse Engineering
Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a software system to understand how it works, especially when thereâ€™s no documentation available.

- 3 levels 
1. High-Level Reverse Engineering
    Focuses on understanding the system's architecture, design, and overall behavior.
    Tools: Decompilers (e.g., JD-GUI for Java), source code analyzers.
    Output: Flowcharts, architecture diagrams, or pseudocode.

2. Low-Level Reverse Engineering
    Deals with assembly-level or machine code analysis.
    Common when source code is unavailable (e.g., analyzing compiled binaries or malware).
    Tools: Disassemblers (e.g., IDA Pro, Ghidra), debuggers (e.g., x64dbg, OllyDbg).
    Output: Assembly code, control flow, system call analysis.

3. Hardware-Level Reverse Engineering
    Focuses on physical components like chips, circuits, and embedded systems.
    Techniques include circuit tracing, microprobing, and side-channel analysis.
    Tools: Oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, microscope

â€¢ Helps recover lost information like flowcharts or data models.
â€¢ Often used when taking over old software or integrating with legacy systems.

Example: 
- You inherit an old desktop application with no documentation, so you analyze its code to
understand how to improve it.
- You have a compiled .exe file but no source code. You use tools to understand how it works â†’ reverse engineering


### ðŸ“Œ 7. Software Re-engineering
Involves analyzing and modifying software to reconstitute it in a new form.

Often includes reverse engineering followed by forward engineering.
Aims to improve software quality and reduce maintenance costs.
Includes activities like refactoring, redesigning, and re-coding.
- eg: You take a 1990s desktop billing system and rebuild it as a modern web app with better UI â†’ re-engineering

### ðŸ“Œ 8. Configuration Management
Process of systematically handling changes in a software system.
Ensures integrity and traceability of the system throughout its lifecycle.

Key Components:
Version Control (e.g., Git)
Change Control (evaluating, approving, and implementing changes)
Status Reporting (tracking change history and current versions)







## Which are the Different Types of Software Maintenance?

When you have released your software application, you might think that all your work is done.
There is more work that needs to be done to make sure your software provides the expected
results and performance.
Thatâ€™s where software maintenance comes into play.
When you opt for custom software development services, you also need to consider software maintenance.
Software maintenance is an important part of the entire software development life cycle (SDLC).
When you want the long-term success of your software product, you need to opt for software maintenance to
keep your software running.
However, there are four core types of software maintenance. Each one is suitable for the particular
conduction of a software product.

### Which are the Four Types of Software Maintenance?
1. Corrective Software Maintenance
Corrective maintenance refers to identifying and resolving issues, bugs, and errors in your software
application after deployment. The issues or bugs get resolved which were left unnoticed during the
development of your software product.Within the corrective type of maintenance, the issues could include
coding errors, design flaws, software dependencies issues, security vulnerabilities, performance issues,
usability issues, or integration issues.All these types of issues or bugs are addressed within the cor rective
maintenance of your software product. Further, learn when corrective maintenance is conducted.Here are the
reasons why you should choose corrective maintenance.When you:
â€¢ Your software solution is developed and users might face bugs that were not discovered during the
development stage.
â€¢ You want to conduct routine system checking to detect problems which could be memory leaks, performance
slowdowns, or unexpected system behaviour.
â€¢ Your software crashes or fails suddenly and you want to find the issues and fix them.
â€¢ You want to conduct software audits to find internal or external issues with your software product.
Usually, corrective software maintenance helps you to resolve the issues or bugs that hinder the software to
work as expected. Moreover, the process followed in corrective maintenance is problem identification,
problem analysis, designing the solutions, development, testing, and documentation.The advantages of
performing corrective maintenance are to improve the usability and performance of your software product.
The frequency and urgency of the corrective maintenance depend on factors like software complex ity, critical
issues or bugs, and usage of your software products by end-users.However, each software maintenance has a
different cost, typically, corrective ranges from 15-20% of costs on overall software development costs. And,
the remaining three software maintenance typesâ€™ costs vary on multiple factors. Read this guide on software
maintenance costs to learn in detail about cost.
In addition, while performing the corrective maintenance, proper documentation of crucial changes is done to
keep track of changes made and for future reference or issues.Now, letâ€™s learn about the second type of
software maintenance which is adaptive maintenance

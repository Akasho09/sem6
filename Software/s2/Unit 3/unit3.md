## Unit 3: Software Requirement Analysis and Specifications, Design & Software Reliability

### üîç Problem Analysis

Understanding the root causes of a problem.

Identifying system goals and constraints.

Involves feasibility study and cost-benefit analysis.

### üìä Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
- Graphical representation of data movement in a system.
- Levels: 

1. Context-level (Level 0), 
2. Level 1, 
3. and Level 2 DFDs.

- Elements: 

1. Processes, 
2. Data stores, 
3. External entities, 
4. and Data flows. 

## üß© Use Case Diagram - Unified Modeling Language (UML)
- A Use Case Diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a visual representation that illustrates the interactions between users (actors) and a system. 
- It captures the functional requirements of a system, showing how different users engage with various use cases, or specific functionalities, within the system. Use case diagrams provide a high-level overview of a system‚Äôs behavior, making them useful for stakeholders, developers, and analysts to understand how a system is intended to operate from the user‚Äôs perspective, and how different processes relate to one another. They are crucial for defining system scope and requirements

### How to draw a Use Case diagram in UML?
Below are the main steps to draw use case diagram in UML:
‚Ä¢ Step 1: Identify Actors: Determine who or what interacts with the system. These
are your actors. They can be users, other systems, or external entities.
‚Ä¢ Step 2: Identify Use Cases: Identify the main functionalities or actions the
system must perform. These are your use cases. Each use case should represent a
specific piece of functionality.
‚Ä¢ Step 3: Connect Actors and Use Cases: Draw lines (associations) between
actors and the use cases they are involved in. This represents the interactions
between actors and the system.
‚Ä¢ Step 4: Add System Boundary: Draw a box around the actors and use cases to
represent the system boundary. This defines the scope of your system.
‚Ä¢ Step 5: Define Relationships: If certain use cases are related or if one use case is
an extension of another, you can indicate these relationships with appropriate
notations.
‚Ä¢ Step 6: Review and Refine: Step back and review your diagram. Ensure that it
accurately represents the interactions and relationships in your system. Refine as
needed.
‚Ä¢ Step 7: Validate: Share your use case diagram with stakeholders and gather
feedback. Ensure that it aligns with their understanding of the system's
functionality.
UML diagrams that show system functionalities from a user‚Äôs perspective.

##  ‚öñÔ∏è Cohesion and Coupling

- Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules. 
- High coupling means that modules are closely connected and changes in one module may affect other modules. Low coupling means that modules are independent, and changes in one module have little impact on other modules.
- Cohesion refers to the degree to which elements within a module work together to fulfill a single, well-

defined purpose.  High cohesion means that elements are closely related and focused on a single purpose, while low cohesion means that elements are loosely related and serve multiple purposes.

High cohesion = better maintainability.

Low coupling = better modularity.

### üì¶ Classification of Cohesiveness & Coupling

- Coupling Types: Data, Stamp, Control, External, Common, Content.

![alt text](image.png)

1. Content Coupling:

Modules share data directly through global variables or parameters. This is the strongest coupling method and is not recommended because it tightly couples the modules and makes them highly dependent on each other.

2. General Coupling:

Modules share global data or resources that are frequently used and modified by different modules. Although not as direct as pooling content, it still represents tight pooling through shared resources.

3. External Coupling:

Modules communicate by exchanging data through external interfaces such as function parameters or method calls. Although external binding is more flexible than content and general binding, it can still cause dependencies.

4. Control Coupling:

One module affects the behaviour of another by passing control information, often through parameters. This type of connection may be less direct than a content connection but still requires close communication.

5. Stamp Coupling:

Modules share a composite data structure such as a record or object without sharing. Changes to the structure can affect several modules, but the connection is weaker than in the content connection.

6. Data Coupling:

Modules share data through parameters, but there is no direct relationship between functions. Compared to the previous types, it is a relatively loose form of connection.

### Cohesion Types: Functional, Sequential, Communicational, Procedural, Temporal, Logical, Coincidental.

![alt text](image-1.png)

Functional Cohesion:

Elements within a module are grouped based on a single, specific functionality or task. This is the strongest form of cohesion, where all elements contribute to the same goal.

Sequential Cohesion:

Elements are organized in a linear sequence, where the output of one element becomes the input of the next. This type of cohesion is often seen in processes with step-by-step execution.

Communicational Cohesion:

Elements within a module work together to manipulate a shared data structure. They might not perform the same function, but their actions are closely related to a common piece of data.

Procedural Cohesion:

Elements are grouped based on their involvement in a specific sequence of actions or steps. They might share some data, but their primary focus is on the sequence of operations.

Temporal Cohesion:

Elements are grouped because they need to be executed at the same time or during the same phase. They might not share functional or data-related aspects.

Coincidental Cohesion:

Elements are grouped arbitrarily without a clear, meaningful relationship. This type of cohesion is typically indicative of poor module design.

## üéØ Function Oriented Design:

![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-04-07 at 3.40.46‚ÄØPM.png>)

Focus on functional decomposition.

Uses DFDs to structure the system.

- In function-oriented design, the system is comprised of many smaller sub-systems known as functions. These
functions are capable of performing significant task in the system. The system is considered as top view of all
functions.
- Function oriented design inherits some properties of structured design where divide and conquer methodology is
used.

## üß± Object Oriented Design

Uses concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
- 
‚Ä¢ Objects - All entities involved in the solution design are known as objects. For example, person, banks,
company and customers are treated as objects. Every entity has some attributes associated to it and has
some methods to perform on the attributes.
‚Ä¢ Classes - A class is a generalized description of an object. An object is an instance of a class. Class defines all
the attributes, which an object can have and methods, which defines the functionality of the object.
More reusable and modular design.
